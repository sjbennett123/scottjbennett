## Joe Valenti

PR Nightmare. Like having the One Pillow guy or the Papa Johns guy as your CEO.

Litigiious

Crass

Pay to Win

## Stagnant NERO

No updates to the game despite paying money for membership fees and events. Other games manage this just fine.



## Props

Keeping all the props in a hot van will quickly break the props. No faster way to do it.

So far we have had issues with wearing out boffers and Fog machines. I bet if we looked more would be in that state. 

If the game can afford that it's fine but it seems foolish.

## Zines

can the game pay for these?

What is the feedback from the game on these.

## Recruiting

Many of the people that are members of the facebook group are from out of state. The actual amount of people that are interested in the game is much lower than I expected.
