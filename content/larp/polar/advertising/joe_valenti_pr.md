PR Nightmare. Like having the One Pillow guy or the Papa Johns guy as your CEO.

- Litigious
  - Bad Contracts with Chapter Owners that they have decided to break. I can't blame the chapter owners for this. They were silly contracts for anyone to agree to in the first place.
  - Whatever is going on with his trademarks... I don't really understand this but the fact that I don't and there is no easy way TO understand it is a bad sign.  ![nero facebook](/images/nero_facebook.png)
- Crass
- Pay to Win
  - Extracting money in this way corrupts the game in the long term. Some people will see this and NOPE out right away. Additionally as the game gets more and more saturated with the high level players new players have a harder and harder time joining. I don't see how you fix this. This is the death knell for the game for the next phase of it's life.
