title: stagnant nero
---

No updates to the game despite paying money for membership fees and events. Other games manage this just fine. Part of this is because nobody will work with Joe Valenti and part of this is that the playerbase will fight tooth and nail against most changes. This lack of change has led to a complicated mess of playtests and addendums that make learning the game very hard. 

 - the nero national facebook page is all people asking if a game is near them and being told that no in fact there are no games near anyone.
