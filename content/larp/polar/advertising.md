## Challenges

NERO is interesting as a place to advertising for because it has in the larp community a terrible reputation. I would be curious how the national organization intends to remedy that reputation of being a bad actor in the larp space. This is among the first things that comes up when you search for the game as seen in the below screenshot in the "what's up with nero link"

Many of the people that are members of the POLAR Facebook group are from out of state and have no intention of attending a POLAR event. The actual amount of people that are interested in actually playing the game is much lower than I expected when I began this research. 

- New players need to join a FB group to get any details. This inflates numbers dramatically.  Should get them to the website where they can get this information more easily.  

- Fliers are inexpensive to create but will require work to get them distributed. Additionally they are hard to know what works and what doesn't. 
  - Who is up for that 
  - what are good targets. I created a list of possible targets for crestfallen located here. https://crestfallenlarp.com/schedule/advertising/
