title: onboarding
---

A large part of the challenge with advertising is actually challenges with onboarding. Once you get someone that is interested they have a lot of reasons to give up and just go do something else. The challenges that I see are below. 

### No Printed Rulebook

There is not a player facing printed rulebook that people can get. I am personally not eager to bootleg a bunch of copies with how litigious Joe V is but if he gave permission getting rulebooks printed would not be hard.

### No collected Policies

The policies that the game uses are mostly known through word of mouth. Things like cancellation policies and if a campsite will allow birdseed or airsoft packet spell packets are big questions that might be known but are not written in any easy to find place. 

### No loaner costuming and props

New players are expected to come to an event with costuming and props rather than the game having items to assist new players. This causes many people in my experience to put off coming to an event. "the first game is free" is small comfort if you need to spend 50 bucks on costuming and boffers instead. 





- **Objective**: Provide incoming players with the material and social support they need to understand and enjoy the
  game as well as encourage continued patronage
- **Goal**: Supply each new player with simple costuming and weapons and/ or spell packets. These materials will
  remain in POLAR’s possession to be utilized on a loan basis.
- **Goal**: Supply each new player with a printed version of the rulebook
- **Goal**: Offer veteran players bonus Goblin Stamps to provide “on the job” training by traveling with the new
  player throughout the event. This should continue for a minimum of five events.
