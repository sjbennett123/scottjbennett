title: Between game actions
---

you would need to stop doing this sort of thing for free for your friends if you charge for it

If the plan is to make money doing it I'd be curious how much money is being thought would be made.

I am really convinced that it is mostly that the "work" is fun. So let's get paid for do fun work!

If they are paid it further segments low income players from the rest of the pack

The problem that I see with between game actions is if they are free it consumed a huge amount of staff time
