## Joe Valenti

PR Nightmare. Like having the One Pillow guy or the Papa Johns guy as your CEO.

- Litigious
  - Bad Contracts with Chapter Owners that they have decided to break. I can't blame the chapter owners for this. They were silly contracts for anyone to agree to in the first place.
  - Whatever is going on with his trademarks... I don't really understand this but the fact that I don't and there is no easy way TO understand it is a bad sign.  ![nero facebook](/images/nero_facebook.png)
- Crass
- Pay to Win
  - Extracting money in this way corrupts the game in the long term. Some people will see this and NOPE out right away. Additionally as the game gets more and more saturated with the high level players new players have a harder and harder time joining. I don't see how you fix this. This is the death knell for the game for the next phase of it's life. 

## Stagnant NERO

No updates to the game despite paying money for membership fees and events. Other games manage this just fine. Part of this is because nobody will work with Joe Valenti and part of this is that the playerbase will fight tooth and nail against most changes. This lack of change has led to a complicated mess of playtests and addendums that make learning the game very hard. 
 - the nero national facebook page is all people asking if a game is near them and being told that no in fact there are no games near anyone. 

## Props

Keeping all the props in a hot van will quickly break the props. No faster way to do it.

So far we have had issues with wearing out boffers and Fog machines. I bet if we looked more would be in that state. 

If the game can afford that it's fine but it seems foolish.

## Zines

The Game CANNOT pay for these it is totally broke. 

What is the feedback from the game on these.

## Recruiting and Advertising

NERO is interesting as a place to advertising for because it has in the larp community a terrible reputation. I would be curious how the national organization intends to remedy that reputation of being a bad actor in the larp space. This is among the first things that comes up when you search for the game as seen in the below screenshot in the "what's up with nero link" 

![nero seo](/images/nero_seo.png)

Many of the people that are members of the POLAR Facebook group are from out of state and have no intention of attending a POLAR event. The actual amount of people that are interested in actually playing the game is much lower than I expected when I began this research. 

- New players need to join a FB group to get any details. This inflates numbers dramatically.  Should get them to the website where they can get this information more easily.  

- Fliers are inexpensive to create but will require work to get them distributed. Additionally they are hard to know what works and what doesn't. 
  - Who is up for that 
  - what are good targets. I created a list of possible targets for crestfallen located here. https://crestfallenlarp.com/schedule/advertising/

## Onboarding

A large part of the challenge with advertising is actually challenges with onboarding. Once you get someone that is interested they have a lot of reasons to give up and just go do something else. The challenges that I see are below. 

### No Printed Rulebook

There is not a player facing printed rulebook that people can get. I am personally not eager to bootleg a bunch of copies with how litigious Joe V is but if he gave permission getting rulebooks printed would not be hard.

### No collected Policies

The policies that the game uses are mostly known through word of mouth. Things like cancellation policies and if a campsite will allow birdseed or airsoft packet spell packets are big questions that might be known but are not written in any easy to find place. 

### No loaner costuming and props

New players are expected to come to an event with costuming and props rather than the game having items to assist new players. This causes many people in my experience to put off coming to an event. "the first game is free" is small comfort if you need to spend 50 bucks on costuming and boffers instead. 

## Community

POLAR needs to do better at getting it's community together outside of games. Things like getting together at a diner or going to mini golf together. I feel like this sense of community would really help with people getting the impression that the game has a good vibe. 

---

- **Objective**: Provide incoming players with the material and social support they need to understand and enjoy the
  game as well as encourage continued patronage
- **Goal**: Supply each new player with simple costuming and weapons and/ or spell packets. These materials will
  remain in POLAR’s possession to be utilized on a loan basis.
- **Goal**: Supply each new player with a printed version of the rulebook
- **Goal**: Offer veteran players bonus Goblin Stamps to provide “on the job” training by traveling with the new
  player throughout the event. This should continue for a minimum of five events.
