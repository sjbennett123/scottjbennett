I have been playing larps since I was 15 years old playing in the local NERO chapter PRO. I then started writing and running content at the NERO writing and running content at the NERO Chapter based out of Meadville PA ran by Robert S Conley of Bat in the Attic games. When Rob retired from running that chapter I ran content for the new owners Bill Hoffman and Matt Armstrong before taking a break for several years to focus on my career. I attended NERO Elkins and assisted with running events that summer before taking over as Gamemaster with Chris Colland. We ran the game for another year before the owner Matt Taylor closed the game down. When NERO POLAR opened in Pittsburgh I worked with the team there to assist in writing and editing and propmaking for their opening event and 3 additional events. I am currently working with Crestfallen LAPR on their website and props and will be releasing a larp design of my own in the coming years.
