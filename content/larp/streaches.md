1) quad stretch: grab foot, pull back, stretch front of your upper leg
2) hamstring/back stretch: fold forward at the waist, touch your toes if you can, relax everything from the waist up
3) standing side stretch: extend your arms straight up over your head and bend side to side without rotating
4) standing hamstring stretch: one foot forward straight, other leg bend, bend forward at the waist, resting your hands on your forward leg, lean forward until you feel it in your butt
5) sitting hamstring stretch: sit, legs straight out in front of you, reach for your toes (alt: place the bottom of one foot on the inside of the other leg, reach for the leg that's still extended)
6) shoulder stretch: one arm straight out, grab the outside of it with your other arm, pull it towards your chest (drop your shoulder if you don't feel a stretch)
7) tricep stretch: arm over your head, bend one elbow, grab that elbow with your other hand and pull it in/back until you feel a stretch
8) neck/trap stretch: arms behind your back, grab one wrist in the other. looking straight ahead, tilt head to one side (ear towards shoulder), hold for 15 seconds. Then, from that position, rotate down as if you are trying to look at your shoulder, hold for 15 seconds. Then, from that position, raise head up as if you are looking directly to that side (may need to tilt slightly back to feel a stretch), hold for 15 seconds.
9) standing IT band stretch: left leg behind right leg, left arm over head, lean to the right without twisting or leaning forward or back, hold 30 seconds, switch sides
10) calf stretch: foot about 4 inches away from a wall, lean forward as if you are pressing your knee towards the wall. you don't have to touch the wall and you can move further away if needed (can also be a fence post or anything else)
