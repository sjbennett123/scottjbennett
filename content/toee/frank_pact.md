## The Dagger says to Airrick 

'Oh child of the Oearth-bound races, I command thee by the power of thy true and rightful given name, I bind thee by high magic and holy writ --- you may never share what you know of me.... with no one, in no way, as long as you are living or dead, as long as your spirit has ever graced the planes of existence --- you may share nothing of me or mine, not in truth nor in implication, not in word nor thought nor deed, not in the way of mortal nor god nor spirit nor magics, not telling nor untelling nor withholding, not with trickery nor cleverness. I bind you creature of your world. I bind you to this'  

## Note

And Airrick cannot, cannot EVER, share anything he knows of the dagger that is not already known explicitly by others. Not now, and not in the future. Anything Airrick learns that is not already known he is unable to share in any way. 

He cannot share anything that just happened, or any knowledge he gained from it. 

He cannot imply, elude to, play questions about, say by not saying, drop hints, etc.  He cannot **reveal** anything he knows that others do not about the dagger, or info he gained or will gain in the future from the dagger.
