### Chromatic Orb

**Level**: 1

**School**: Alteration, Evocation

**Range**: 0

**Components**: V, S, M(A gem of the appropriate hue or any diamond. The gem must have a value of at least 50 gp.)

**Duration**: Special

**Casting Time**: 1

**Area of Effect**: One creature

**Saving Throw**: Neg.

> This spell causes a 4-inch-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. Within the limits described below, the sphere can appear in a variety of colors; each color indicates a different special power. The caster can hurl the sphere at an opponent up to 30 yards away, providing there are no barriers between the caster and the target. If the target is no more than 10 yards away, the caster's to hit roll is made with a +3 bonus. If the target is 10-20 yards away, the caster's roll is made with a +2 bonus. If the target is 20-30 yards away, the caster's roll is made with a +1 bonus.
>
> If the *chromatic orb* misses its target, it dissipates without effect. If the target creature makes a successful saving throw, the chromatic orb is also ineffective. Otherwise, the color of the *orb* determines the amount of damage inflicted and its special power, as summarized on Table 16; details about the special powers are listed below. The caster can create a single *orb* of any color listed for his level or lower; for instance, a 3rd-level wizard can create an orange, red, or white *orb*. The material component for this spell is a gem of the appropriate hue or any diamond. The gem must have a value of at least 50 gp.
>
> *Light* from the *orb* causes the victim to become surrounded by light to a radius of 20 feet, as if affected by a light spell. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time the victim makes his attack rolls and saving throws at a -4 penalty, and his AC is penalized by 4.
>
> *Heat* from the *orb* is intense enough to melt 1 cubic yard of ice. The victim suffers a loss of 1 point of Strength and 1 point of Dexterity (or for victims without these attributes, -1 to hit and a penalty of 1 to AC) for 1 round.
>
> *Fire* from the *orb* ignites all combustible materials within 3 feet of the victim.
>
> *Blindness* from the *orb* causes the victim to become blind as per the spell. The effect lasts for 1 round/level of the caster.
>
> *Stinking cloud* from the *orb* surrounds the victim in a 5-foot-radius noxious cloud. The victim must save vs. poison or will be reeling and unable to attack until he leaves the area of the vapors. *Magnetism* from the *orb* has an effect only if the victim is wearing armor made from iron. The iron armor becomes magically magnetized for 3-12 (3d4) rounds. Other iron objects within 3 feet of the caster will stick tight to the magnetized armor; only *dispel magic* or a similar spell can release the stuck items. At the end of the spell's duration, the stuck items are released.
>
> *Paralysis* from the *orb* causes the victim to become paralyzed for 6-20 (2d8 + 4) rounds; a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation halves the number of rounds.
>
> *Petrification* from the *orb* turns the victim to stone. If the victim successfully saves vs. petrification, he avoids turning to stone and instead is slowed (as per the spell) for 2-8 (2d4) rounds. *Death* from the *orb* causes the victim to die. If the victim successfully saves. vs death magic, he avoids death and instead is paralyzed for 2-5 (1d4 +1) rounds.

### Armor

**Level**: 1

**School**: Conjuration

**Range**: Touch 

**Duration**: Special 

**Area of Effect**: 1 creature 

**Components**: V, S, M (A piece of finely cured leather that has been blessed by a priest)

**Casting Time**: 1 rd. 

**Saving Throw**: None 

> By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative with the *shield* spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The *armor* spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is important to note that the armor does *not* absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the *armor* spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.
>

###  Cantrip

**Level**: 1

**School**: All Schools

**Range**: 10 ft. 

**Duration**: 1 hr./level 

**Area of Effect**: Special 

**Casting Time**: 1 

**Saving Throw**: None 

> Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The *cantrip* spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the *cantrip* spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. However, these effects are so minor that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.
>
> Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the *unseen servant* spell, it's a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard.

### Burning Hands

**level**: 1 

**School**: Alteration

**Range**: 0 

**Duration**: Instantaneous 

**Area of Effect**: The caster 

**Components**: V, S

**Casting Time**: 1 

**Saving Throw**: Â½ 

> When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: The wizard's thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets 5 feet long in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage. Flammable materials touched by the fire burn (for example, cloth, paper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such materials can be extinguished in the next round if no other action is taken.
>

### Change Self

**Level**: 1

**School**: Illusion, Phantasm

**Range**: 0

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 2d6 rds. + 2 rds./level

**Casting Time:** 1

**Area of Effect**: The caster

**Saving Throw**: None

> This spell enables the wizard to alter the appearance of his form--including clothing and equipment--to appear 1 foot shorter or taller; thin, fat, or in between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The caster cannot duplicate a specific individual. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. The duration of the spell is 2d6 rounds plus two additional rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster. The DM may allow a saving throw for disbelief under certain circumstances: for example, if the caster acts in a manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen role. The spell does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e., touch) properties of the caster or his equipment, and the ruse can be discovered in this way.
>

###  Comprehend Languages

**Reversible**

**Level**: 1 

**School**: Alteration

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M(A pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.)

**Duration**: 5 rds./level

**Casting Time**: 1 rd.

**Area of Effect**: 1 speaking

**Saving Throw**: None

> When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to understand the spoken words of a creature or read an otherwise incomprehensible written message (such as writing in another language). In either case, the wizard must touch the creature or the writing. Note that the ability to read does not necessarily impart understanding of the material, nor does the spell enable the caster to speak or write an unknown language. Written material can be read at the rate of one page or equivalent per round. Magical writing cannot be read, other than to know it is magical, but the spell is often useful when deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (the 3rd-level secret page and illusionary script spells), and it does not reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.
>
> The reverse of this spell, confuse languages, cancels a comprehend languages spell or renders a writing or a creature's speech incomprehensible, for the same duration as above.
>

### Detect Magic

**Level**: 1 

**School**: Divination

**Range**: 0

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 2 rds./level

**Casting Time**: 1

**Area of Effect**: 10 x 60 ft.

**Saving Throw**: None

> When the detect magic spell is cast, the wizard detects magical radiations in a path 10 feet wide and up to 60 feet long, in the direction he is facing. The intensity of the magic can be determined (dim, faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming), and the wizard has a 10% chance per level to recognize if a certain type of magic (alteration, conjuration, etc.) is present. The caster can turn, scanning a 60-degree arc per round. A stone wall of 1 foot or more thickness, solid metal of 1 inch thickness, or a yard or more of solid wood blocks the spell. Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may confuse or conceal weaker radiations. Note that this spell does not reveal the presence of good or evil, or reveal alignment. Otherplanar creatures are not necessarily magical.
>

### Enlarge

**Reversible**

**School**:  Alteration

**Range:** 5 yds./level

**Components****: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron.)

**Duration**: 5 rds./level

**Casting Time**: 1

**Area of Effect**: 1 creature or object

**Saving Throw**: Neg.

> This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight.
>
> All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.
>
> Magical properties are not increased by this spell--a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.
>
> For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.
>
> The reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch--the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.
>
> For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.
>

### Shatter

**School**: Alteration
**Range**: 30 yds. + 10 yds./level
**Components**: V, S, M (a chip of mica.)
**Duration**: Instantaneous
**Casting Time**: 2
**Area of Effect:** 3-ft. radius
**Saving Throw**: Neg.

> The shatter spell is a sound-based attack that affects nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, etc. All such objects within a 3-foot radius of the center of the spell effect are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than one pound per level of the caster are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition must save vs. crushing blow or be shattered. Alternatively, the spell can be focused against a single item of up to 10 pounds per caster level. Crystalline creatures usually suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a maximum of 6d6, with a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.
>

### Feather Fall

**school**: Alteration
**Range**: 10 yds./level
**Components**: V   
**Duration**: 1 rd./level
**Casting Time**: 1
**Area of Effect**: Special
**Saving Throw**: None

> When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a piece of down. The rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere 2 feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, a normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard. The *feather fall* affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster.
>
> For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell. The spell works only upon free-falling, flying, or propelled objects (such as missiles). It does not affect a sword blow or a charging creature. Note that the spell can be effectively combined with *gust of wind* and similar spells.
>

###  Identify

**level**: 1
**School**: Divination
**Range**: 0
**Components**: V, S, M(a pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned.)
**Duration**: 1 rd./level
**Casting Time**: Special
**Area of Effect**: 1 item/level
**Saving Throw**: None

> When an identify spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.
>
> The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only one function of a multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.
> The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged.
>
> After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).
>

### Magic Missile

**level**: 1
**School**: Evocation
**Range**: 60 yds. + 10 yds./level
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: Instantaneous
**Casting Time**: 1
**Area of Effect**: 1-5 targets
**Saving Throw**: None

> Use of the magic missile spell creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target. This includes enemy creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must be able to identify the target. He cannot direct a magic missile to âStrike the commander of the legion,â unless he can single out the commander from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect. Against creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage.
>
> For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile--he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple missile capability, he can have them strike a single target creature or several creatures, as desired.

### Protection From Evil

**level**: 1
**school**: Abjuration
**Reversible**
**Range**: Touch
**Components**: V, S, M
**Duration**: 2 rds./level
**Casting Time**: 1
**Area of Effect**: Creature touched
**Saving Throw**: None

> When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects:
> First, all attacks made by evil (or evilly enchanted) creatures against the protected creature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; any saving throws caused by such attacks are made with +2 bonuses.
>
> Second, any attempt to possess (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over (as by a vampire's charm ability) the protected creature is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through the barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast.
>
> Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if such attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character.
> This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
>
> To complete this spell, the wizard must trace a 3-foot-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) with powdered silver.
> This spell can be reversed to become protection from good; the second and third benefits remain unchanged. The material component for the reverse is a circle of powdered iron.

### Unseen Servant
**level**: 1
**School**: ConjurationSummoning)
**Range**: 0
**Components**: V, S, M(a piece of string and a bit of wood.)
**Duration**: 1 hr. + 1 turn/level
**Casting Time**: 1
**Area of Effect**: 30-ft. radius
**Saving Throw**: None

> The unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, and shapeless force, used to step and fetch, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as to clean and mend. It is not strong, but unfailingly obeys the command of the wizard. It can perform only one activity at a time and can move only lightweight items, carrying a maximum of 20 pounds or pushing/pulling 40 pounds across a smooth surface. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, etc. The unseen servant cannot fight, nor can it be killed, as it is a force rather than a creature. It can be magically dispelled, or eliminated after receiving 6 points of damage from area-effect spells, breath weapons, or similar attacks. If the caster attempts to send it beyond the allowed radius, the spell ends immediately.

### Read Magic

**School**: Divination
**Range**: 0
**Components**: V, S, M The wizard must have a clear crystal or mineral prism, which is not expended, to cast the spell.
**Duration**: 2 rds./level
**Casting Time**: 1rd.
**Area of Effect**: Special
**Saving Throw**: None

> By means of a read magic spell, the wizard is able to read magical inscriptions on objects--books, scrolls, weapons, and the like--that would otherwise be totally unintelligible. (The personal books of the wizard, and works already magically read, are intelligible.) This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and the wizard has read the magical inscription, he is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of the read magic spell. The duration of the spell is two rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster; the wizard can read one page or its equivalent per round.
> 
>

###  Continual Light

**Reversible**
**School**: Alteration
**Range**: 60 yds.
**Components**: V, S This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in the typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials can last hundreds or even thousands of years.
**Duration**: Permanent
**Casting Time**: 2
**Area of Effect**: 60-ft. radius
**Saving Throw**: Special

> This spell is similar to a light spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated by magical darkness or by a dispel magic spell. Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. When cast at a creature, the target gets a saving throw vs. spell; success indicates that the spell affects the space about 1 foot behind the creature instead. Note that this spell can also blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs, reducing its attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
>
> A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.
>


### ESP

**level**: 2 

**school**: Divination

**Range**: 0 (90 yds. maximum)

**Components**: V, S, M The material component of this spell is a copper piece.

**Duration**: 1 rd./level

**Casting Time**: 2

**Area of Effect**: 5 yds./level

**Saving Throw**: None

> When an ESP spell is used, the caster is able to detect the surface thoughts of any creatures in range--except for those of undead and creatures without minds (as we know them). The ESP is stopped by 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead foil.
>
> The wizard employing the spell is able to probe the surface thoughts of one creature per round, getting simple instinctual thoughts from lower order creatures. Probes can continue on the same creature from round to round or can move on to other creatures. The caster can use the spell to help determine if a creature lurks behind a door, for example, but the ESP does not always reveal what sort of creature it is. If used as part of a program of interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives an initial saving throw. If successful, the creature successfully resists and the spell reveals no additional information. If the saving throw is failed, the caster may learn additional information, according to the DM's ruling. The creature's Wisdom adjustment applies, as may additional bonuses up to +4, based on the sensitivity of the information sought.
>


### Invisibility

**Level**: 2

**School**: Illusion, Phantasm

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M(n eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter.)

**Duration**: Special

**Casting Time:** 2

**Area of Effect**: Creature touched

**Saving Throw**: None

> This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Note, however, that light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).
>
> The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first. Note that the priest spells bless, chant, and prayer are not attacks for this purpose. All highly Intelligent (Intelligence 13 or more) creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels of experience have a chance to detect invisible objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; success means they noticed the invisible object).

###  Knock

**Reversible**

**School**: Alteration

**Range**: 60 yds.

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Special

**Casting Time**: 1

**Area of Effect**: 10 sq. ft./level

**Saving Throw**: None

> The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard-locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains. If used to open a wizard-locked door, the spell does not remove the former spell, but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds--although the former could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Note that the effect is limited by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x 7-ft. door). Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two knock spells. In all cases, the location of the door or item must be known--the spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes of discovering a secret door.
>
> The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated locking mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot affect a portcullis.

### Shatter

**School**: Alteration

**Range**: 30 yds. + 10 yds./level

**Components**: V, S, M(a chip of mica.)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Casting Time**: 2

**Area of Effect**: 3-ft. radius

**Saving Throw**: Neg.

> The shatter spell is a sound-based attack that affects nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, etc. All such objects within a 3-foot radius of the center of the spell effect are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than one pound per level of the caster are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition must save vs. crushing blow or be shattered. Alternatively, the spell can be focused against a single item of up to 10 pounds per caster level. Crystalline creatures usually suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a maximum of 6d6, with a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.
>

### Web

**level**: 2

**School**: Evocation

**Range**: 5 yds./level

**Components**: V, S, M The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web.

**Duration**: 2 turns/level

**Casting Time**: 2

**Area of Effect**: 8,000 cubic ft.

**Saving Throw**: Neg. or Â½

> A web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points--floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc.--or the web collapses upon itself and disappears.
> The web spell covers a maximum area of eight 10-foot x 10-foot x 10-foot cubes and the webs must be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers.
> Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs.
>
> Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round.
>
> Furthermore, the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire--torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc.--can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed.

**Fly**

**In Scroll**

**School**: Alteration

**Range**: Touch 

**Duration**: 1 turn/level + 1d6 turns 

**Area of Effect**: Creature touched 

**Components**: V, S, M  The material component of the *fly* spell is a wing feather of any bird.

**Casting Time**: 3 

**Saving Throw**: None 

> This spell enables the wizard to bestow the power of magical flight. The creature affected is able to move vertically and horizontally at a rate of 18 (half that if ascending, twice that if descending in a dive). The maneuverability class of the creature is B. Using the *fly* spell requires as much concentration as walking, so most spells can be cast while hovering or moving slowly (movement of 3). Possible combat penalties while flying are known to the DM (found in the â

###  Death Recall

**Level**: 3

**School**: Necromancy, Divination

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (The material component for this spell is a fragment from a shattered mirror)

**Duration**: Special

**Casting Time**: 1 round

**Area of Effect**: One corpse

**Saving Throw**: None

> This spell enables the caster to visualize the final minutes of the life of any creature or person that died within the previous 24 hours. When the caster touches the subject's corpse, the caster goes into a trance. The caster then has a vision of the final 10 minutes of the subject's life as seen by the subject himself. The vision ends with the last scene the subject saw before he died, at which time the caster awakens from his trance and the spell is over.

###  Dispel Magic

**School**: Abjuration

**Range**: 120 yds.

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Casting Time**: 3

**Area of Effect**: 30-ft. cube

**Saving Throw**: None

> When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with, as follows:
> First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).
>
> Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.
>
> A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.
>
> Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM's option.
> Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions.

### Hold Undead

**School**: Necromancy

**Range**: 60 ft.

**Components**: V, S, M(The material component for this spell is a pinch of sulphur and powdered garlic.)

**Duration**: 1d4 rds. + 1 rd./level

**Casting Time**: 5

**Area of Effect**: 1d3 undead

**Saving Throw**: Neg.

> When cast, this spell renders immobile 1d3 undead creatures whose total Hit Dice are equal to or less than the caster's level. No more than three undead can be affected by a single spell. To cast, the wizard aims the spell at a point within range and the three undead closest to this are considered to be in the area of effect, provided all are within the field of vision and spell range of the caster. Undead of a mindless nature (skeletons, zombies, or ghouls) are automatically affected. Other forms of undead are allowed a saving throw to negate the effect. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead immobile for the duration of the spell.

### Suggestion

**School**: Enchantment, Charm

**Range**: 30 yds.

**Components**: V, M(A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.)

**Duration**: 1 hr. + 1 hr./level

**Casting Time**: 3

**Area of Effect**: 1 creature

**Saving Throw**: Neg.

> When this spell is cast by the wizard, he influences the actions of the chosen recipient by the utterance of a few words--phrases or a sentence or two--suggesting a course of action desirable to the spellcaster. The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizard's suggestion--it must be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands.
>
> The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizard's party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power.
>
> The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed. If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the DM. Undead are not subject to suggestion.

### Water Breathing

â		**In Scroll**

**Reversible**

**School**: Alteration)

**Range**: Touch 

**Duration**: 1 hr./level + 1d4 hrs. 

**Area of Effect**: Creature touched 

**Components**: V, S, M  The material component of the spell is a short reed or piece of straw.

**Casting Time**: 3 

**Saving Throw**: None 

> The recipient of a *water breathing* spell is able to breathe water freely for the duration of the spell. The caster can touch more than one creature with a single casting; in this case the duration is divided by the number of creatures touched. The reverse, *air breathing* enables water-breathing creatures to comfortably survive in the atmosphere for an equal duration.

### Drawmijâs Instant Exit (Alteration-Conjuration)

**In scroll**

**Level**: 4

**Components**: V, S, M

**Range**: 30 yds

**Casting Time**: 1 segment

**Duration**: 1 round

**Saving Throw**: None

**Area of Effect**: Special

> This spell enables the mage and others to use a limited and risky form of teleportation. When the spell is cast, a door suddenly appears on a wall or other flat surface within 3 yards of the caster. The caster and as many others who can pass through the door in one round (usually at the rate of one creature or person per segment) can enter into a zone of nil-space by passing through the doorway. When the door is closed behind by the mage, the mage and all those with him in the nil-space zone are teleported to a random location within 250 yards of the door. If the door is not closed before the end of the spellâs duration, then the door slams shut automatically at the end of the round. The door disappears when closed by the mage or after it shuts itself.
>
> The party has no control over where they will be teleported, and there is always a 5% chance the spell will malfunction and dump the party into the ethereal plane. To determine where the mage and his friends are sent, consult the DM map, track back along the path of the party, and place them in a random area where they have been before. This spell cannot send the party into unknown territory. The material component is a miniature silver door decorated with ruby chips worth 5,000 g.p. that vanishes after the spell is cast.

### Detect Scrying

**In Scroll**

**School**: Divination

**Range**: 0

**Components**: V, S, M  The material components for this spell are a small piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet.

**Duration**: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/level

**Casting Time**: 3

**Area of Effect**: 120-ft. radius

**Saving Throw**: Special

> By means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt to observe him by means of clairvoyance, clairaudience, or magic mirror. This also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magical scrying devices, provided the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to âsweepâ areas for the duration of the spell.
>
> When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a saving throw. If this is failed, the identity and general location of the scryer immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The general location is a direction and significant landmark close to the scryer. Thus, the caster might learn, âThe wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs,â or, âYou are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol.â

### Wall of Force

**School:** Evocation 

**Range**: 30 yds.

**Components**: V, S, M The material component for this spell is a pinch of powdered diamond worth 5,000 gp.

**Duration**: 1 turn + 1 rd./level

**Casting Time**: 5

**Area of Effect:** 10-ft. square/level

**Saving Throw**: None

> A wall of force spell creates an invisible barrier in the locale desired by the caster, up to the spell's range. The wall of force cannot move and is totally unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. However, a disintegrate spell will immediately destroy it, as will a rod of cancellation or a sphere of annihilation. Likewise, the wall of force is not affected by blows, missiles, cold, heat, electricity, etc. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through it in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier.
>
> The wizard can, if desired, form the wall into a spherical shape with a radius of up to 1 foot per level or an open hemispherical shape with a radius of 1.5 feet per caster level. The wall of force must be continuous and unbroken when formed; if its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails. The caster can end the spell on command.
