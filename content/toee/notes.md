I was about to go to sleep with Galahad and leave Autumn to sleep along in the basement of the welcome wench. Autumn speaks to Galahad and I about staying in the basement so that she is not alone. We agree to stay there. I speak to Autumn about the nature of magic and how we are all built on the sholders of those that came before. 

When I wake up I give Autumn my 5 sheets of paper at her request and go to the grove. When I arrive at the grove I speak to Brother Smyth about using his forge. I offer to get him lunch from the Welcome Wench but he turns me down. Jerry then after Brother Smyth turns his back expalins that I MUST get him a tasty meal from the wench. I was a bit confused why Brother Smyth didn't take me up on my offer but I went along with it. I request that Jerry pick up some sheets of paper from the trading post.
