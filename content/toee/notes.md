I was about to go to sleep with Galahad and leave Autumn to sleep along in the basement of the welcome wench. Autumn speaks to Galahad and I about staying in the basement so that she is not alone. We agree to stay there. I speak to Autumn about the nature of magic and how we are all built on the sholders of those that came before.

When I wake up I give Autumn my 5 sheets of paper at her request and go to the grove. When I arrive at the grove I speak to Brother Smyth about using his forge. I offer to get him lunch from the Welcome Wench but he turns me down. Jerry then after Brother Smyth turns his back expalins that I MUST get him a tasty meal from the wench. I was a bit confused why Brother Smyth didn't take me up on my offer but I went along with it. I request that Jerry pick up some sheets of paper from the trading post.

While working in the forge with Brother smyth. I forge the hinges. They are IMACULATE. I then hear Honey and Jerry return and they offer to melt down the gloves and honey's Wedding Band. I cannot belive that she is giving that up. Couldn't she have just bought some silver somewhere else? I offered some encouragment about the spell component that we are creating but it was not recieved well at all. Jerry grabbed my face and growled at me. I'll never underdstand why these people get so upset but I probably should have said something else I will need to talk to Autumn about this.
