Certain was a a hero in the first war and st Cuthbert made him sainthood. 

His wife died in a raid. He and his gnome brethren made a tombs for his dead wife. 

He went off to war. He died so heroically that St. Cuthbert who he was a priest of made him a saint/demigod
what certain chose to do with that is inhabit the tomb with his dead gnome wife and if any heroes are in extraordinary need and facing a great evil. they can seek out the tomb and if they can prove that they are worthy then he may lend them extraordinary help.
