> Years fly by like dead leaves. Everything is darkness. Everything is
> silence. You stand vigilant before the sarcophagus without thought
> or breath- such is your compulsion. You do not remember your
> name and still you watch. The flesh has fallen off your bones
> and still you watch.
> And then one day there is light and motion and you weigh your
> bearded axe and raise your shield, lusting for the fray, eager to
> measure your skill against these tomb-robbing children so full
> of blood. Youâ€™ll never be alive again, but in this moment- in the
> chaos between violation and destruction- you truly live, and you
> remember what you once were, and you taste the sun.
