## Character Pitches

Brief descriptions of the characters

## Preamble

Grandfather had lived a long life—perhaps  ultimately a wealthy man. He settled, raised a family and enjoyed his grandchildren. As grandfather grew older and more frail, he came to fear death…and the Hell that beckoned. So, as a good son, Thorvald arranged a proper death for his father. The families dug up some old unpaid weregeld, summoned all of the young men—cousins, nephews, etc.—and took to the field to settle the debt. Grandfather himself was sat in a cart, his sword lashed to his hand. At a signal, the families joined in battle and Tyr himself strode up to Grandfather and delivered the fatal blow. Grandfather died in battle; to Valhalla he goes. We now gather to celebrate his funeral.

## A Prayer to Odin

“Let us pray the Father of Hosts be gracious to us!
He granteth and giveth gold to his servants…
He giveth victory to his sons, to his followers wealth,
Ready speech to his children and wisdom to men,
Fair wind to captains and song to poets;
He giveth luck in love to many a hero.”

—a prayer to Odin, from the Saxo Grammaticus
